## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention!

This is a boilerplate designed for direct operations from a mobile application with AWS services, specifically the S3 Bucket. While this approach provides flexibility, please be aware that storing credentials within the mobile app can be insecure. It may expose sensitive information to malicious users. Always follow best practices for security and consider using server-side operations or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to handle credentials and sensitive operations.
